# Qamio

**Qamio** is a modular, extensible, and open-source operating environment, designed as the core execution layer for QAOS. It brings a secure and scalable architecture with a component-based kernel and a flexible user-space layout, aiming to serve as a modern base for embedded, desktop, and experimental computing platforms.


## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Every system component is built as an independent package. Qamio supports hot deployment, fine-grained access control, and dynamic service composition.
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation between system, vendor, product, and user layers ‚Äî fully Treble-style.
- **Secure Execution**: Controlled module loading, capability-based permissions, and a trusted module system.
- **Minimal Core Kernel**: The `com.qaos.kernel` module only handles loading and delegation ‚Äî everything else is a pluggable component.
